# Notes

Let $\mathcal{C}$ is a category.

if a function (a morphism) doesn't collapse a domen objects by mapping on a codomen (in other words each domen member has its own single subdomen member) then the function is **injective** - monomorphism.

if a function (a morphism) image fully covers its codomen by mapping (in other words there are no objects in the codomen that are not a second member in a $\to$ b function) then the function is **surjective** - epimorphism.

If a function is injective and surjective at the same time it is isomorphism.
